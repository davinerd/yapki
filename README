==========================================================================
YAPKD - Yet Another Port Knocking Daemon
YAPKC - Yet Another Port Knocking Client

This two scripts are written in bash and these need to be 
installed on the system. Just copy them on a system directory.

The `passwd` file provided contains simple passwords
which are needed by the server to let the user log in.

####IMPORTANT: Please change the variable `CRYPTOKEY` on both the client and the server

Also, use the `PASS` variable to set up the password file.

Both the workstation with server and client must have the same password 
file with the same name.

####IMPORTANT: CHANGE THE PASSWORD FILE!!!

For any changes, modify the scripts :)

Thanks to all mawkers that make me insane.

Special Thank to Sonne, who started the project on 2005, whitout his 
great code and style I didn't code anything ;)
